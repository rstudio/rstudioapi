\arguments{
\item{name}{A descriptive name to assign to the job.}

\item{cluster}{The name of the cluster this job should be submitted to.}

launched with this job.}

\item{stdin}{Data to be written to stdin when the job process is launched.}

\item{stdoutFile}{The file used for the job's generated standard output. Not
all launcher plugins support this parameter.}

\item{stderrFile}{The file used for the job's generated standard error. Not
all launcher plugins support this parameter.}

\item{workingDirectory}{The working directory to be used by the command /
executable associated with this job.}

\item{host}{The host that the job is running on, or the desired host during
job submission.}

for more information.}

\item{resourceLimits}{A list of resource limits. See
\code{\link[=launcherResourceLimit]{launcherResourceLimit()}} for more
information.}

\item{resourceProfile}{A resource profile name to be used for the job. The
resource profile must be defined in the cluster configuration.}

\item{queues}{A list of available submission queues for the cluster. Only
applicable to batch systems like LSF.}

\item{config}{A list of cluster-specific configuration options. See
\code{\link[=launcherConfig]{launcherConfig()}} for more information.}

\item{user}{The user-name of the job owner.}
